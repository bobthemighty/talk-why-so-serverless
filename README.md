Why so Serverless?
------------------

This talk was written for the Growable meetup February 2020

Slides are rendered with the [1-2-3 remark theme][1].

To serve the slides, run a webserver rooted at the top level directory, eg. if the talk is checked out to /tmp/foo then

```sh
cd /tmp/foo
python -m http.server
echo "slides available on localhost:8000"
```
